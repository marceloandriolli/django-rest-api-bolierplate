A REST API Boilerplate: Django + Django Rest Framework
=================

After work some projects with Django + Django Rest Framework, doing a setup for every new project from the begin become repetitive nad boring stuff. So I decided create this repo with a common project setup that make sense for projects that I work. 

This boilerplate has:
==============
1. Some configs of project with env variables like: SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, ALLOWED_HOSTS, DATABASE_URL etc.. with python decouple lib
2. API doc
3. Heroku config file
4. Or AWS Lambda( Zappa config)
